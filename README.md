The “Akkadian and Hittite Emotions in Context (AHEC) – Towards a Lexicon of Emotions in Cuneiform Texts from Ancient Mesopotamia and Hittite Anatolia” is a collaboration between Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz and University of Tel Aviv, funded by DFG.   

Types of Hittite emotional terms can be divided into 18 macrodomains, corresponding in semantics with their Akkadian counterparts. For details, see Semantics of emotions - Guidelines.
